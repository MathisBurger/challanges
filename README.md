# Challenges

A simple minecraft server plugin built with spigot to provide some 
fun challenges in the modern minecraft version 1.20.4

Although I only built this for my friends, it is free for everybody. Just feel free to load it onto your server
and play some fun challenges.

## Supported challenges

- Randomizer


## Usage

Run the `/randomizer` command on the server to start a randomizer challenge.


## Development

Because this is a fun project their will only be development in this plugin, if I want 
to build a new challenge for me and my friends
